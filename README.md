# LiquidFunx
LiquidFun physics library port for haxe
(http://google.github.io/liquidfun/)

Port based on the jbox2d java port by Daniel Murphy using Box2D 2.3.0 and LiquidFun 0.9 (for more info visit: http://www.jbox2d.org/).

Compiles for Flash, HTML5 and C++ targets (haven't tested any other targets).
Also runs in Android and iOS but is extremely slow, unfortunetly.
Needs optimization to allow for better performance in Flash but runs fine in cpp.

Features (as taken from from jbox2d)

Rigid body physics<br>
Stable stacking<br>
Gravity<br>
Fast persistent contact solver<br>
Dynamic tree broadphase<br>
Sliding friction<br>
Boxes, circles, edges and polygons<br>
Several joint types: distance, revolute, prismatic, pulley, gear, mouse<br>
Motors<br>
Sleeping (removes motionless bodies from simulation until touched)<br>
Continuous collision detection (accurate solving of fast bodies)<br>
Ray casts<br>
Sensors<br>
Dynamic, Kinematic, and Static bodies<br>
Liquid particle simulation from Google's LiquidFun <br>

Feel free to contribute.
