# liquidFunx
LiquidFun physics library port for haxe
(http://google.github.io/liquidfun/)

Port based on the jbox2d java port by Daniel Murphy (for more info: http://www.jbox2d.org/)

Compiles for Flash and C++ targets (haven't tested any other targets).
Needs optimization to allow for better performance in Flash but runs fine in cpp.

Features (as taken from from jbox2d)

Rigid body physics
Stable stacking
Gravity
Fast persistent contact solver
Dynamic tree broadphase
Sliding friction
Boxes, circles, edges and polygons
Several joint types: distance, revolute, prismatic, pulley, gear, mouse
Motors
Sleeping (removes motionless bodies from simulation until touched)
Continuous collision detection (accurate solving of fast bodies)
Ray casts
Sensors
Serialization
Dynamic, Kinematic, and Static bodies
Liquid particle simulation from Google's LiquidFun
