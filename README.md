# LiquidFunx
LiquidFun physics library port for haxe
(http://google.github.io/liquidfun/)

Port based on the jbox2d java port by Daniel Murphy (for more info: http://www.jbox2d.org/)

Compiles for Flash and C++ targets (haven't tested any other targets).
Needs optimization to allow for better performance in Flash but runs fine in cpp.

Features (as taken from from jbox2d)

Rigid body physics<br>
Stable stacking<br>
Gravity<br>
Fast persistent contact solver<br>
Dynamic tree broadphase<br>
Sliding friction<br>
Boxes, circles, edges and polygons<br>
Several joint types: distance, revolute, prismatic, pulley, gear, mouse<br>
Motors<br>
Sleeping (removes motionless bodies from simulation until touched)<br>
Continuous collision detection (accurate solving of fast bodies)<br>
Ray casts<br>
Sensors<br>
Serialization<br>
Dynamic, Kinematic, and Static bodies<br>
Liquid particle simulation from Google's LiquidFun <br>

Feel free to contribute.
